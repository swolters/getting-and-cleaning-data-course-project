The script run_analysis.R executes the following steps:

1. Sets the working directory, loads library, reads data from working diretory and adds column names.
2. Merges files into one dataset.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject in file tidy.csv.
